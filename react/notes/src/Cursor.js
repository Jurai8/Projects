import React, { useState } from 'react';

export function Cursor () {
    return (
        // create the vertical line
        // how to return what the user is typing
        // update letter and put cursor in front of last letter
        <div className="text">
            <h1>lorem</h1>
        </div> 
    )
}



/* in a word document if you click at the bottom of the page the cursor won't go there 
   it only follows the words. conversly you could just press enter and then the 
   div would grow. enter = ''
   
   idea.
   if the user types a letter on keyboard what they type gets added to element <p>
   
   or what they type is returned by js?*/
