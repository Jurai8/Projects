# Polyglot

Polyglot is an app that aims to aid a user in their language learning journey

Polyglot specifically seeks to improve a learners written communication, by focusing on these
key aspects:

1. Vocabulary
2. Grammar
3. Writing
4. Testing

## Vocabulary

The goal here is to allow the user to collect as much vocab as possible.
The vocabulary will be stored in collections.
The leaner will not only be able to store the vocabulary, but also test themselves, by means of vocab tests.
Another method that will help them learn their vocabulary, is by using it. This is where the writing section comes in, but before we get to that we need to go over the grammar section

## Test

Here the user can test themselves on the vocabulary that they have saved.
They have two options:

- Quickstart a test

- Schedule a test for a later date

## For the future

### Grammar

A section where the user can do grammar exercises for their chosen language

### Writing

In this section the user can combine everything that they've learned, buy writing a short story or a short essay. They will then get evaluated based on syntax and grammer and also the length of the essay.
